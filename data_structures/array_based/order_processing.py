# TODO: Define the OrderManager class
# This class should manage orders using a SortedDict where priorities determine the order processing sequence

# TODO: Add the `add_order(customer, priority)` method to the class - it should map the customer to its priority (priority is stored as a key)

# TODO: Add the `process_order()` method that processes the order with the highest priority (the order is removed after processing)

# TODO: Initialize the OrderManager class

# TODO: Add a couple of orders using the add_order method, with a unique priority for each

# TODO: Retrieve and print the next order to process - the one with the highest priority
