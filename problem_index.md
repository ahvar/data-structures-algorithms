# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Problems

1. Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.
 - Dynamic Programming
 - Expand around Center
 - Manacher's Algorithm
 - String Manipulation

2. Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
 - Binary Search

3. Verify if parenthesis in a text are well-matched, that is, every bracket has a corresponding pair
