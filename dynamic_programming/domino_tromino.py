"""
You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large,
return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there
are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

Notes:
Define dp[i] = "number of ways to tile a 2 x i board completely"
You will derive a recurrence for dp[i] that depends only on a few previous dp valuesâ€”so you only need a 1D array of length n+1.
